What is inheritance?
    It's a mechanism through which a class can inherit the properties and methods of another class.
Why we should learn inheritance?
    It helps use avoid code duplication.
    It helps us save space.
    It helps us improve the execution speed.
What is the syntax?
We use the extends keyword and the name of the class from which we want to inherit the fields
and methods while declaring the class.
Types of inheritance:
    There can be 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them with classes.
    1) Single.
    2) Multilevel.
    3) Hierarchical.
    4) Multiple(it is not supported by classes in java).
Single inheritance:
    When we have only one parent and one child classes in inheritance it is called single inheritance.
    not widely used.
Multilevel Inheritance:
    One top level and one base class and many intermediate classes. For Example A<B<C<D.
Hierarchical Inheritance:
    When we have one parent class and multiple child classes it's called Hierarchical Inheritance.
Multiple Inheritance:
    One child and multiple parent classes. it is not supported by classes in java. It creates the diamond problem.
