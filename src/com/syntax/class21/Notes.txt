Overriding-overriding parent method in child classes.
The access level cant be more restrictive than the overridden method.
Can't override private/static methods/fields.
Constructors cant be overridden.
Static method cannot be overridden,but we can re-declare it. Will behave differently depending on the object/method  using it.
